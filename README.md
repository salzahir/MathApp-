# ShufMath üéìüì±

**ShufMath** is a SwiftUI-based educational tool designed to make practicing multiplication and division fun and interactive. With customizable difficulty settings, a timer, and real-time score tracking, this app helps users improve their math skills in an engaging and competitive way. The app has been refactored to follow the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture for better code organization, maintainability, and scalability.

## Features üåü

### Gameplay Features:
- Randomly generated multiplication and division questions.
- User input validation with feedback (correct/incorrect answers).
- Real-time score tracking during gameplay.
- Timer to track performance within a set time limit.
- Supports decimal inputs for more advanced practice.

### Customization & Settings:
- Select number range and question quantity.
- Custom Difficulty with adjustable max multiplier/divider.
- High score tracking to motivate continuous improvement.

### Clean UI Design:
- Built using SwiftUI for a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.
- Responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to various iOS devices and screen sizes.

## App Icon üé®
The app icon, **appIcon**, represents the app's dynamic and interactive nature. It features a **shuffle symbol**, which reflects the flexibility of choosing between multiplication, division, or a mix of both modes. The colorful design ties into the app's fun and engaging vibe, perfectly capturing the spirit of learning while offering customization options.

## What I Learned
- **State Management:** Gained proficiency in managing app state with `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject`, and `@Binding` in SwiftUI, enabling efficient data flow and reactivity.
- **UI/UX Design:** Applied basic UI/UX principles to improve the user interface, focusing on clarity and responsiveness. Integrated dynamic elements like haptic feedback, sound effects, and progress indicators for a more engaging experience.
- **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Architecture:** Refined understanding of the MVVM design pattern by restructuring the app to separate business logic from UI components, improving maintainability and testability.
- **Game Logic Implementation:** Developed custom game logic, including handling user input, scoring, and question management. Implemented logic to ensure valid inputs and a smooth user experience.
- **Git and Version Control:** Utilized Git for version control, making frequent commits and maintaining a well-structured commit history to track project progress.
